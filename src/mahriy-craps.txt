Assignment Overview:
(Describe your understanding of the purpose and scope of the assignment in 250 words or less.

the assignment description.)
In this assignment we had to create "Game of Craps" using java swing. The game has to roll the
dices, calculates the sum and determines if the player won or lost. The main thing is to create a
GUI application with menus, buttons, and labels that interact with the user. The application should
include functionalities like starting the game, resetting the session, displaying rules, and handling user bets.
The program structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The logic for the game is placed
in the model package, the entry point and control logic in the controller package, and the GUI components in the
view package. Key features of the program include a menu with options to start the game, reset the session, and exit,
a help menu with options to display information about the application and the rules of the game, buttons for rolling
the dice and playing the game again, displaying the results of each roll, including die values, total, and point,
updating and displaying win totals, enabling and disabling buttons and menu items based on the game state, handling
user input for the starting bank account value and bets.

Technical Impression:
(Describe what you have done to complete the assignment in 200-500 words. The word count is not strict,
so don't worry about going slightly over; however, summaries that do not meet the minimum length requirement
or are trivial in nature (representing little thought or effort) will not get full credit. You can share
your personal experiences, things that particularly frustrated you about the assignment, things that
particularly interested you about the assignment, etc. It is especially important that you document any
difficulties you had with tools, Java libraries, etc.)
This assignment was tough for me because I haven't done a big project like this from the beginning, especially
one that involves creating a graphical interface (GUI). Dealing with the GUI part, I used layouts to organize
different sections of the interface. It was a bit tricky to arrange these parts neatly, and connecting them
together in the code was challenging. I realized there was a lot to do, and I faced more and more issues with
the code. Despite the difficulties, I enjoyed making the game. However, the time pressure made things a bit
stressful. The hardest part was using layout managers to organize panels on the interface. Figuring out how
to put and arrange these panels in the right way took some effort. Connecting these panels together within
the MVC design pattern, which divides the code into Model, View, and Controller, was another tough challenge.
As the project moved forward, dealing with the code complexity became apparent. Managing the game's logic,
like rolling dice, figuring out wins, and updating the game state, added layers of difficulty. I had to spend
time finding and fixing issues in the code. Making the functionality for simulating dice rolls, determining
wins and losses, and updating user accounts felt like an achievement. This assignment taught me the importance
of planning and managing time in programming projects. In the end, even though it was hard, this assignment
helped me learn a lot about GUI development, the MVC pattern, and problem-solving in programming.

Unresolved problems in my submission:
(Use this space to list problems which you know exist in your submission. This could include program features
which you did not have time to implement, bugs in your code, warnings generated by the tools which you did not
understand or did not have time to correct, or other issues. I give a reduced grade penalty for problems which
I find in your submission that are listed here and a larger penalty for those which are not. Just say 'none' if
there are no issues that you are aware of.)
Model-view-controller might be implemented wrong.
